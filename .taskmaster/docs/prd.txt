## Executive Summary
Build a unified, sensory-friendly AI development sanctuary for neurodivergent creators. The platform features 7 core pages, each an immersive, themed environment with Mama Bear agent presence, persistent memory, and seamless navigation. Integrate 12 mini-apps and official model icons for all supported AI models (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, etc.) using 21st.dev (magic MCP) for UI inspiration and logo search.

1. Home Sanctuary – Welcome dashboard, daily briefing, agent presence.
2. Memory Palace – Persistent chat, context, memory visualization.
3. Creation Studio – Code build, agent plans, orchestration, mini-app launcher.
4. Learning Hub – Docs, tutorials, AI learning, interactive guides.
5. Sensory Garden – Calming widgets, theme selection, accessibility controls.
6. Agent Command Center – Manage/configure agents, model selection, model icons.
7. Logs & Activity Feed – History, notifications, real-time events.
